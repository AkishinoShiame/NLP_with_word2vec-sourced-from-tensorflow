# NLP_with_word2vec-sourced-from-tensorflow
<h1> NLP with deep learning project </h1>
This is the Project for experimenting the NLP and word2vec.<br>
In this project I reuse the word2vec from <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/tutorials/word2vec/index.html">here</a>.<br>
This project is in progress, but till now I've no idea about what application will be applied in the future.<br>
Please be free to come and have a look! :D <br>
